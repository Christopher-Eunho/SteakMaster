*Steak Master* is application to help people make perfect steaks at home. Cooking at home is becoming many people's new hobby in the era of prolonged pandemic, and steaks are one of the most popular dishes to try among the home cheifs. They might look esay to make and take less time than other dishes. However, people who have ever tried to make steaks at home would not say it was just easy for following difficulties. A relatviely short time needed for cooking steak is not always a benefit for home cooks because that means you are more likely to overcook your meat if you do not finish the cooking or, if you do not properly cook your meat in a short time, you may end up serving a raw steak which you intended to be rare.  
To ease these difficulties, *Steak Master* help people successfully cook steaks with real-time cooking assistant that tells you what to do at the perfect time during your cooking. Also, you can create, delete, and track down your recipes using Steack Master. The developer of this app, Chris, has been a meat lover for more than five years. But it took many years for him to finally achieve a stablized steak quality he wants because the instructions online are not sufficient, so he learned the details of steak cooking from many trial-error processes. *Steak Master* is built to reduce those time wasted on unnecessary tiral and errors for those who never tired to make steaks or people who attempted to make steaks but failed everytime.
